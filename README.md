# Food_caculator
I decided to make a food calorie caculator for myself 
This simple food calorie tracker helps me track how much calories im eating a day and seeing if im reaching my calorie and protien goals.
My ULTIMATE goal with this code is to make a website or app with this code and reslease this app later in the future for people who want this caculator.
\/
This caculator will have tons of resturants and fast foods and if you see a place you don't see on the code and want to add your own place, then be my guest. 
Most of these places are from Ellensburg Washington at the university of washington home of the wildcats!!!!
